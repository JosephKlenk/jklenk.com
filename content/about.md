 # About Me


## Hi!

>My name is **Joseph Klenk** and I am currently a college student 
going for a bachelors in Computer Science, and a minor in Business. While different from my major, my passions are 
education, content creation, and personal finance. I have been creating content on YouTube and TikTok since January 2022. My main goals are 
creating a supportive and welcoming community of like minded individuals and creating educational content 
about personal finance, career tips, and developing on TikTok and YouTube.
